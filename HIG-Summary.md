Form follows function

Use familiar paradigms

Provide feedback so doing an action feels like it’s doing something

Use negative space to make intractable things stand out

User is in control, the app shouldn’t do things by itself

Default settings should be good enough, average user should not need to change settings.

Make a launch screen, should be in the same orientation as the app

Don’t do license agreements in app

Don’t reboot

Don’t wait for everything to load, get basic functionality and placeholders up to make the app feel more responsive

Request permission only when needed

Put infrequent settings in the settings app

Design must work on every screen size for the device

Primary content must be clear at default screen size
 Support dark mode

Use animation to make the connection from user to app more fluid

Element function should be apparent at a glance

Use color to draw attention to important things
